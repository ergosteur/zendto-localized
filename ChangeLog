Version 4.10-5 29th May 2012
- Fixed bug where Admins cannot see stats graphs, only stats viewers can see
  stats graphs.

Version 4.10-4 24th May 2012
- Added protection against malicious attacks causing massive httpd error log
  files caused by attempts to download non-existent files.
- Added note to outgoing emails saying how long the recipient has to pick up
  the drop-off before it expires.
- Fixed bug where administrators didn't get a "Delete Dropoff" button for
  drop-offs with more than 1 recipient.
- Added new preferences setting 'bccSender' (switched off by default) which
  makes the sender receive a Bcc copy of the email message sent to the 1st
  recipient of each new drop-off.
- Fixed various bugs where it was failing to remember library file
  descriptions set in previous drop-offs.
- Fixed issue with Safari 5.2 betas not restoring input focus correctly.
- Added patch from Francois Conil to handle situation with pickups when
  they use the form to enter drop-off details (no clicked-on link) and
  are not using CAPTCHAs.
- Added new preferences.php setting 'authStats'. Users listed in this group
  can do normal user functions and also see the usage statistics graphs.
  They cannot do any other admin functions.
- Fixed problems with repeated CAPTCHAs being displayed when enforcing
  human-only downloads, particularly when recipient is not logged in, and
  enters claimid and passcode manually (i.e. not using an email link).
- Removed disabling autocommit in MySQL, as I do want automatic COMMIT
  except when I explicitly disable it.
- Fixed problem with some PHP installations incorrectly reporting uploaded
  file sizes.
- Fixed problem with some PHP systems giving errors on ob_flush() when
  downloading dropoffs.

Version 4.09-1 26th January 2012
- IMAP authentication now works with multi-domain sites where users login
  with their full email address instead of just their username. Simply
  set the "authIMAPDomain" to "" in preferences.php and it will behave as
  you want it to.
- Fixed bug whereby uploaded filenames containing a '%' character would
  cause the generation of blank emails to recipients.
- Fixed various (totally harmless) PHP notices about undefined indices,
  courtesy of Igor Zivkovic. Also fixed bug causing maxSubjectLength setting
  to be ignored.
- Added FreeBSD installation guide, courtesy of Jared Davenport.
- Added missing icons for Datatables support in "list all drop-offs".
- Applied minor syntax patches from Igor Zivkovic. Thanks!
- Added ability to disable virus scanning by setting command to "DISABLED".
- Fixed bug causing fatal error in use of "Files Library" when using MySQL.
- Fixed display bug in recent Chromes causing "Add Recipient" dialog to
  display slightly incorrectly.
- Fixed bug where downloads would not display properly if humanDownloads
  is TRUE but the captchas are disabled.
- Added new feature: the libraryDirectory can contain sub-directories.
  If there is a subdir named the same as a username, that user will see
  the list of files from their subdir instead of the "default" top-level
  subdir's files. At any point, if a user ends up with no files to choose
  from, the drop-down list is not shown in the user interface.
  So if you make the libraryDirectory not contain any files, but just a
  subdir for 1 user, only that user will see any sign of the "library"
  interface at all.
-2 If humanDownloads was TRUE, it would not correctly log the email address
  of the user picking up the dropoff. Now fixed.

Version 4.08-4 10th December 2011
- Added new feature: each file in a drop-off can either be uploaded, or else
  it can be taken from a library directory containing reference files which
  you often need to send to recipients/customers. To use this feature, you
  must enable it by setting "'usingLibrary' => FALSE," in preferences.php
  and put the library files into the directory set by the preferences.php
  setting 'libraryDirectory' (set to /var/zendto/library by default).
  This must just be a single directory of files, and not contain any
  subdirectories. You may choose to make the library directory accessible
  by WebDAV so that administrators using either Windows or Mac systems
  can map a network drive pointing to it. To set this up, Google for
  either "ubuntu apache webdav" or "centos apache webdav". It's a fairly
  simple operation provided you just want 1 fixed username and password
  to have write access to it. Alternatively you can just sftp files into
  it (or psftp on Windows if using "PuTTY").
- Fixed size of download file so that the download will always download
  the full size of the file as the file is now, not as it was when the
  drop-off was created. If it's a library file, you might choose to replace
  the file with another version between when the drop-off is created and when
  recipients actually download it.
- Fixed various bugs in new "library of files" feature, and made it only
  appear to users who are logged in.
- Fixed layout of filesizes in New Drop-off form, which shows up in browsers
  capable of this (such as Chrome).
- If you upgrade to this release and use MySQL, you will need to read
  /opt/zendto/sql/README.MySQL and run the 2nd mysql command in there again.
  It will not overwrite anything, but will extend the database structure to
  support the new "file library" feature.

Version 4.07-1 24th November 2011
- Fixed background colour of upload progress dialog part so greys all match.
- Added a new feature, to make unauthenticated users pass a CAPTCHA test
  before they can pick-up any file. This helps protect against automated
  Denial-of-Service attacks. It is enabled by setting "humanDownloads" to
  true in preferences.php.
- Improved progress bar so it never reports < 0%.
- Requests can now be sent to multiple email addresses at once. Separate
  the list of addresses with any combination of ";" and "," and " ".
- International characters used in email addresses, subjects, notes and
  domains should work properly now. Thanks to Phil (UxBoD) for this!
- Fixed bugs in regular expressions in email function.
- Corrected grammar mistake in show_dropoff.tpl.
- List of all drop-offs now uses JQuery "DataTable" code to present a nice
  list spread over multiple pages, with search and so on facilities.
- Nice sortable lists of drop-offs ported to MyZendTo.

Version 4.06-2 27th September 2011
- Fixed 2 security problems in HTML handling.
- Stats graphs y-axis will now always start at 0.
- Added total size at the bottom of lists of drop-offs.
- Fixed bug in AD authenticator where logins attempted with email addresses
  instead of usernames were incorrectly handled. Now correctly ignores @ and
  everything after it in the supplied username.
- AD authenticator now handles "domain\username" logins as well as "username"
  and "username@domain.com" type login attempts.
- Make illegal username attempts show the user an error, previously just
  quietly re-presented the login page.
- Made bars wider on graphs for >= 90 days to provide some data smoothing.
- Fixed timestamp errors from rrdInit.php which was stopping it from working.
- Fixed more rrdInit.php database problems. Now produces sensible figures.
- IE and Firefox will now warn you if you try to leave the page while
  uploading a Drop-off, which would abandon the drop-off. Safari and Chrome
  should support this feature in the future. Thanks UxBoD ! (Safari and Chrome
  support for this feature will be added very soon.)
-2 Fixed EOL sequence problem in deliverEmail() so all systems (Unix and
   Windows) will send email correctly formatted.

Version 4.05-2 16th August 2011
- Changed sender address of all email messages sent by ZendTo. They are now
  sent with the "From" address set to the value of "EmailSenderAddr" in
  zendto.conf, and a "Reply-To" address set to the person who caused the
  email to be sent. This should solve all your mail relaying and SPF problems.
- Added some help text to the main menu page, so users know what to do.
  Note that this uses a new zendto.conf setting "OrganizationType".
- If you are using Active Directory authentication, you can search for the
  user in more than 1 OU if you need to, in either or both forests/domains.
  To do this, set the 'authLDAPBaseDN1' and/or 'authLDAPBaseDN2' settings
  to be an array of OUs instead of a single OU, expressed like this:
    'authLDAPBaseDN1' => array('OU=Staff,DC=mycompany,DC=com',
                               'OU=Interns,DC=mycompany,DC=com'),
  There is no need to make them arrays if you are only searching a single OU
  in each forest/domain.
- Been through the "request a drop-off" key word list by hand, line by line,
  and removed 726 words that were dubious, confusing, not in common usage, or
  awkward to spell or pronouce.
- Added a default quota for MyZendTo users so you don't have to add a record
  to your local MySQL/SQLite user list for everyone that can authenticate.
- Implemented "Resend Dropoff" button in page showing a drop-off. Useful
  when recipients fail to receive (or delete or lose) the notification email.
- Done some clearups of MyZendTo so it doesn't show you the Claim ID or
  Passcode of your drop-offs, as that confuses users and doesn't help.
- Added a commented-out section to www/css/local.css showing how to make
  the website narrower left to right.
- Improved logging of requests sent and dropoffs deleted.
- Added administrator-only "System Log" button to show recent log entries.
- Upgraded to latest release of Smarty to fix error showing dropoff sizes.
- Fixed problem with libphp5.so in CentOS x64 VM build.

Version 4.03-3 29th July 2011
- Forced usernames to all lower case when creating users, so case can be
  safely ignored when users use ZendTo.
- Fixed security issue with ClaimID and Passcode being given away to users.
- Fixed bug causing "0" email address when there is no "mail" attribute in
  the user's AD object.
- Improved references to encryption tools in New Dropoff form.
- Improved fixDropoffTable.php in upgrading guide to support both databases.
- Updated URL for recaptcha admin site, where you get the keys.
- Added checking for maxBytesForFile and maxBytesForDropoff in "new dropoff"
  form. Only works on some browsers (eg. Chrome) as most can't do it yet.
- Started implementation of "Resend Dropoff" button.
- Fixed db handle bugs in fixDropoffTable.php.
- Fixed bug in dropoff.php causing errors in some browsers. Thanks NA Jared!
- Fixed "division by zero" errors in user database management scripts.
- Added support for quotas to MyZendTo. Read sql/README.MySQL for upgrade guide
- Now displays file and drop-off sizes where possible.
- Can now sort drop-offs by contents and date in MyZendTo.
- Made AD authenticator accept email addresses as well as usernames, for users
  who do not understand the difference. Simply ignores @.... in the username.
- Added RedHat 6 instructions for rebuilding PHP libraries to handle >2GB files.
- Removed unnecessary log debug output (specifically "Comparing" line).
-3 Fixed bug in requests where it would not allow any uploads on new browsers.

Version 4.02 26th May 2011
- Added image to "Statistics" page when no stats have been stored.
- Added preferences.php setting 'authIMAPOrganization'.
- Added preferences.php setting 'authLDAPOrganization'.
- "phpfix.php" web page updated to cope with Ubuntu 11.
- Fixed bug in template so when showRecipsOnPickup is FALSE, the Drop-Off
  Summary page will not list the recipients (unless you're an admin).
- Changed default supplied value of showRecipsOnPickup to TRUE.
- Changed database table setups to 255 characters for IP address for IPv6.
- Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Added new "favicon" to ZendTo websites.
- Fixed security vulnerabilities pointed out by Patrick Gaikowski.
- Added www/css/local.css and discourage editing of swish.css.
- Improved image on "Statistics" page when no stats have been stored, to
  explain why it has not drawn any graphs.
- Implemented new user interface on MyZendTo.

Version 4.01 22nd April 2011
- Added support for non-standard http and https port numbers.
- Fixed warning from some PHP systems about passing by reference.
- Added support for all 8-bit characters in email messages sent out.
- Fixed another warning about passing lvalues only.
- Fixed problems with virus scanning failing in CentOS VMs and documentation for CentOS.
- Added IE6 detection with warning link to Microsoft's upgrade page.

Version 4.00 16th April 2011
- Edited template so that page shown when a Request For a Drop-Off has been
  sent now shows the name and email address the request was sent to.
-3 Removed a load of mentions of ECS from zendto.conf.

Version 3.94 6th April 2011
- All major IE display problems fixed, with many thanks to Craig Chambers
  for his hard work!

Version 3.93 3rd April 2011
- Fixed problem with missing email notifications to recipients.

Version 3.92 3rd April 2011
- Removed graduated blue backgrounds in buttons in IE9 as the nice corners
  look better and we can't clip the graduated background to the corners
  properly due to browser bugs. Prior to 9, IE cannot do rounded corners
  anyway, so we might as well keep the graduated backgrounds.
- Fixed script errors in IE.
- Dropoffs now work in IE.
- I really hate IE, it's rubbish. Give me Safari or Firefox 4 any day.
- Rearranged "Show Dropoff" page to make it clearer.
- Fixed bad English grammar in various templates.

Version 3.91 1st April 2011 (not a joke)
- Updated various templates.
- Improved handling of IE7 hugely.
- Fixed login page for local IPs.
- Fixed problem of not sending email.

Version 3.90 30th March 2011
- Installed all files relating to new user interface.
- Fixed bug in request page so name and email of recipient are labelled right.
- Fixed various template problems.

Version 3.75 26th March 2011
- Added tickbox to "New Dropoff" page to allow you to not inform the
  recipients that there is a drop-off waiting for them. If they are a
  member of your organisation (i.e. they can log in) then they can find
  the drop-off by listing all the "drop-offs for me" from the main menu.
- Improved list of available characters for random ClaimID and ClaimPasscode
  generation so they are less confusing.
- Added checks for whitespace on the ClaimID and Passcode in the Pick-up
  dialog, to cope with claimids that are pasted from emails with a newline
  on the end which you can't see.
- Changed sort order of dropoffs for and from the user to show newest first
  instead of last.

Version 3.74 19th March 2011
- Added web page describing database structure, logging details and so on.
- Improved help text for user management commands in /opt/zendto/bin so
  they don't tell you about ZENDTOPREFS if it's already set.
- Force entered usernames in login box to lower case.

Version 3.73 16th March 2011
- Improved authenticator so things still work if a user doesn't have an AD
  or LDAP 'mail' attribute or 'cn' attribute set.
- Improved user management scripts so adding the prefs path when it isn't
  needed (because ZENDTOPREFS is already set) won't cause any harm.

Version 3.72 11th March 2011
- Slight rearrangement of main menu for users who are not logged in.
- Added template variable {$islocalIP} to change the main menu depending
- on whether your user is a local one (and so should login first) or not.
  New preferences.php variable for this: 
  'localIPSubnets' => array('139.166.','152.78'),
- When you have createad a "Request a Drop-off" request, you are given the
  request code which may be entered at the "Drop-off Files" menu to short-
  circuit all the identification if the user cannot wait for the email to
  arrive containing the link they need to submit their files.
- Codes for "Request a Drop-off" requests are now a list of 3 words, making
  them easy to dictate over the phone to a customer.
- Moved more error messages from the code to zendto.conf.
- Upgraded Smarty to latest release and improved packages to clean Smarty
  cache directories when upgrading DEB, or RPM packages.
- Removed per-authentication mechanism 'Admins' setting, replaced with 1
  common 'authAdmins' setting which covers all authenticators.
- Added loads more documentation.
- Made www/css directory into config files for RPM and DEB builds.
- Subject lines can now contain international characters. Thanks to Barry
  Kwok for his valuable input on this.
- Fixed problem with non-authenticated users trying to send files to bad
  domains.
- Improved Debian/Ubuntu installer so it does not overwrite any existing
  ZendTo website definition, and removes rogue comment from one of the PHP
  configuration files that generates a warning every time Apache is restarted.

Version 3.71 23rd February 2011
- Fixed problems with responses to requests not working if the customer is
  not logged into ZendTo.
- Added over-ride for recipient email address for files dropped off in
  response to a ZendTo request for files.
-2 Fixed tiny regexp typo in emailDomainRegexp testing.

Version 3.70-2 22nd February 2011

- Fixed problem with missing upload progress bar in MyZendTo.
- Added a new "Request a Drop-off" feature, to support customer service
  operations needing to send requests to users for files, ensuring that
  their files end up in the correct ticket work log.
- Created a Debian build.
- Fixed bug in dropoffs page when not using real progress bars.

Version 3.65 12th February 2011

- Fixed problems with upload progress bar in Internet Explorer.
- Made regexp checks in preferences.php case-insensitive.

Version 3.64 4th February 2011

- Added LDAP/AD authorization in addition to authentication, so users must be
  members of a particular group/role in order to access ZendTo.
- Moved bad login credentials error message into zendto.conf.
- Improved error reporting when locked-out users attempt to log in.
- Ensure we don't offer more file uploads than PHP will permit in php.ini.
- Recaptcha service can now be reached via a proxy server if required.
- Fixed detection of $ZENDTOPREFS shell variable in commands in bin directory.
- Implemented various bug-fixes and new progress bars.
- Stopped progress bar appearing until it reads <100%.
- To install all the needed bits to get the progress bars working, read this:
  http://www.zend.to/progressbar.php
- Added progress bars to MyZendTo as well. Untested.

Version 3.63 3rd October 2010

- Minor template changes to new_dropoff.tpl to use ServiceTitle instead
  of calling it "ZendTo". Also changed "Add Address" to "Add Extra Recipient".
- Fixed bug in new_dropoff.tpl causing it to display "1" page.

Version 3.62 6th September 2010

- Fixed a few minor bugs. Added "expiryDate" to the available variables
  when showing a dropoff, customise the template show_dropoff.tpl if you
  want to show it.
- Added 'maxBytesForFile', 'maxBytesForDropoff', 'retainDays' to the list
  of available template variables in every template file.
- Cosmetic template changes.
- Fixes for LDAP authenticator.
- Fixed "delivery confirmation" problem with MySQL.
- Added authentication Dn and Password to LDAP authenticator. Note new
  settings are 'authLDAPBindDn' and 'authLDAPBindPass'.
- Moved website from www.zendto.com to www.zend.to.
- Added full instructions on setting up an https SSL website for ZendTo.
- Fixed problem with only the 1st pickup being listed in a dropoff. You
  need to do a "mysql --user=zendto --password='your-password-here' zendto"
  and then doing "drop table pickup;". You then need to reimport the database
  schema by reading the instructions in /opt/zendto/sql. This only affects
  MySQL setups (RedHat/Fedora/CentOS), it does not affect SQLite setups
  (Ubuntu) at all.
- Changed all HTTP_HOST to be SERVER_NAME instead.

Version 3.61 7th August 2010

- Emails are now definitely being sent correctly, and all database
  functionality is present.
- Note that when upgrading, if you are using SQLite you need to run
  pretty much *all* of the "add*.php" scripts in the /opt/zend/sbin/...
  UPGRADE directory. Running them when you don't need to won't do any harm.

Version 3.60 7th August 2010

- Added "LDAPUseSSL" setting to preferences.php for secure LDAP
  authentication.
- Added sample "LDAP" section to preferences.php.
- Improved LDAP authenticator.
- Added Admin-only "Unlock Users" button which will take you to a page
  where you can selectively unlock any users who are locked out.
  Works in ZendTo and MyZendTo.
- Added "authLDAPFullName" setting to those required to use the LDAP
  authenticator. This contains a space-separated list of the names of the
  properties which together build the user's full name. So if their first
  name is in the "givenName" property and their surname is in the "sn"
  property, then you set
    authLDAPFullName => "givenName sn",
  in preferences.php. Obviously on a Chinese site you might use "sn givenName".
- Changed many mentions of "dropbox preference" file in supporting scripts to
  say "ZendTo preferences.php" file.
- Added support for shell environment variable "ZENDTOPREFS" which, if set,
  tells all the scripts where to look for the preferences.php file so you
  can omit it from the command-line and they will find it on their own.
- Fixed bug in LDAP and AD authenticators that caused problems when
  attributes had an array of 2 or more values.
-2 Fixed bug where email announcing dropoff not sent to recipients.
-3 Omitted DBLoginlogAll() from distribution. Doh! :-(

Version 3.59 2nd August 2010

- Added 2 new preferences.php settings "loginFailMax" and "loginFailTime"
  to protect against brute-force attacks on your authentication system.
  If there are "loginFailMax" failed attempts in a row within any
  "loginFailTime" seconds then the user being attacked is locked out until
  the "loginFailTime" expires.
  By default the Max=6 attempts and Time=1 day. So 6 failed attempts in a
  row in 1 day will lock out that account. It will be automatically
  unlocked again after 1 day.
  If you are upgrading to this version (or one beyond it) you need to add
  the new table to the database:
  Either (if you are using SQLite) run the script
    /opt/zendto/sbin/UPGRADE/addLoginlogTable.php,
  Or     (if you are using MySQL) read the file
    /opt/zendto/sql/README.MySQL and run the long "mysql" command in there.
  To unlock a user "jkf" manually, use the command
    /opt/zendto/bin/unlockuser.php /opt/zendto/config/preferences.php jkf
  To unlock *all* users immediately, use the command
    /opt/zendto/bin/unlockuser.php /opt/zendto/config/preferences.php -a
- MyZendTo now has the ability to delete dropoffs straight from the
  "My Dropoffs" list. Saves a click or two per item. Not decided whether
  I will add this to the main ZendTo application yet or not.
- Cosmetic tidy-up of MyZendTo.
-2 Added "MYZENDTO" setting into preferences.php.

Version 3.58 25th July 2010

- Added entire new application called "MyZendTo". Simply edit preferences.php
  and set "MYZENDTO" to "TRUE" at the top.
  MyZendTo is an application only available to logged-in users, and it gives
  them their own filestore of dropoffs. When they create a new dropoff, they
  don't have to send it to anyone else at all, and they can list their
  own dropoffs and download any one of them, and delete them.
- Improvements in comments in preferences.php.
- The file pointed to by "emailDomainRegexp" now support "//"-style comments
  as well as "#" comments.
-2 Change requests from Brian Duncan for MyZendTo. Cosmetic mostly.
-2 Removed the only reference to the Active Directory "cn" attribute and
   replaced it with "displayName" which is used everywhere else.

Version 3.57 22nd July 2010

- Added notes to the documentation to fix the timezone correctly first.
  This will stop problems with IE7 not accepting logged-in users correctly.
- Added note to preferences.php about the virus scanner, and how to use
  clamscan if you really cannot get clamdscan to work at all.
- Added note to the RPM docs describing how to set up ClamAV and clamd.
- Preferences.php setting "emailDomainRegexp" can now be a filename instead
  of a regular expression. If so, it should provide a file containing a
  list of domain names (and all their sub-domains) that un-authenticated
  users can send dropoffs to. There must be exactly 1 domain per line.
  Blank lines and comment lines starting with '#' are ignored. The file
  is automatically re-read if it is modified.
- Improved error reporting and comments in AD authenticator. It will now
  try to tell you exactly what went wrong, but still check a list of
  AD servers to find one that works.
-2 Re-implemented "emailDomainRegexp" cache from scratch. Cache is now useful.
   NOTE: If you are upgrading to this release, then before using this
         you must add the regexps table to the database using:
         SQLite - run the script /opt/zendto/sbin/UPGRADE/addRegexpsTable.php
         MySQL  - read /opt/zendto/sql/README.MySQL

Version 3.56-2 20th July 2010

- Fixed broken "main menu" link in template verify_sent.tpl.
- Email addresses read from AD are trimmed of whitespace.
- Regexp defining any valid email address is now set in preferences.php.
  NOTE: You need to update your preferences.php file when upgrading to this!
- Added a new authenticator "Local". This uses an SQL database table (stored
  in the ZendTo database) to contain a list of users and their details.
  In /opt/zendto/bin you will find a little set of scripts for maintaining
  the list of users. Their names are self-explanatory.
  For usage help, just run them without any command-line parameters.
  NOTE: If you are upgrading to this release, then before using this
        you must add the user table to the database using:
        SQLite - run the script /opt/zendto/sbin/UPGRADE/addUserTable.php
        MySQL  - read /opt/zendto/sql/README.MySQL
-2 Allowed capital letters in email addresses.
-2 Fixed bug introduced stopping Local authenticator from always working.

Version 3.55 10th July 2010

- New website.
- Improved www buttons so they are clickable over the whole button and
  not just the text.
- Fixed bug in IMAP authenticator.
- Improved main menu template to get "ZendTo" names from zendto.conf.
- Added 1-line comment to show how to get cookieSecret setting.
- Fixed bug causing rrdInit.php to fail on MySQL systems.

Version 3.54 6th July 2010

- Changed supplied usernameRegexp to allow "@" signs in usernames.
- Changed all PHP scripts so they start with /usr/bin/php.
- Changed default upload limits so they will always work on 32-bit platforms.
- Slight improvement to "upload in progress" indicator formatting.
- Fixed $hostname bug in pickup_email.tpl.

Version 3.53 4th July 2010

- Added "upload in progress" indicator to new_dropoff page.
- Added sensible "From:" and "Reply-To:" headers to all email messages.
- Removed some more unused old preferences.php settings.
- Sender email authentication message now has proper "From" address.
- IMAP authenticator ensures all used user properties are filled.
- Unused code removed from NSSUtils.php.
- Error reporting improved greatly when log file cannot be written to.
- 2 HTML typos fixed causing IE to fail on the sender verification page.
- Removed 'dropboxDomain' and replaced it with 'authIMAPDomain' as that
  reflects what it actually does.
- Fixed default log path to be /var/zendto/zendto.log.
- Fixed HTML bug in template causing Safari error console to report error
  on pages when not logged in.
- Tidied up NSSIMAPAuthenticator.php so it's readable.

Version 3.52 30th June 2010

- Fixed bug in dropoff.php which generated an error.
- Fixed bug where pickup notification emails had no subject.
- 2 Fixed IMAP authentication.

Version 3.51 29th June 2010

- Improved documentation.
- Fixed everything so it will run over http and not insist on https.
- Improved VMWare distributions so the web server works out of the box,
  and installed Postfix to handle mail generated by ZendTo.
- Separated all user interface code from program code, makes it much
  easier to customise for your site and brand, while still being able to
  upgrade.
- Fixed various bugs introduced in v3.50.

Version 3.20 22nd June 2010

- Repackaged all VMWare distributions.

Version 3.13 21st June 2010

- Fixed another bug in emailDomainRegexp handling.

Version 3.12 21st June 2010

- Fixed bugs in emailDomainRegexp handling.

Version 3.11 20th June 2010

- Added "function checkRecipientDomain()" in each of the authenticators.
  This enables you to write a function that decides if a recipient address
  is acceptable for an un-authenticated user (ie. a user who has not logged
  in). Most people won't need this, but they can write it if they need to.
- Added "-" to the list of characters acceptable in a username supplied in
  the "Login" box. This is set near the bottom of www/preferences.php.
- Greatly improved the handling of "emailDomainRegexp" so it works more
  sensibly, doesn't matter if you put "/" characters around it or not.

Version 3.10 20th June 2010

- If you are not logged in, you must verify your email address if you
